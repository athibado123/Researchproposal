    <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Over the past roughly two years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed a massive increase in the utilization of online learning resources used to continue the movement of school during these times. Nowadays it is just about as common to have an online class to an in person class, however the meaning of an “online class” has begun to vary depending on the course and professor. I am interested in this shift to using online tools in an academic environment and how this has affected overall student morale and learning. I think it is imperative that in this time we note and document the kind of changes that have been temporarily implemented in our society/universities and how this is currently affecting this generation of college students. Education is, and will continue to be an ever important tool of humanity so it should be assumed that research that treats the nature and status of learning tools in relation to students is extremely important. </p>
